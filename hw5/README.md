## Steps to run the assignment
1. To run the any and all of the files that we made for the homework assignment, you will need to run `python3 puzzlesolver.py <file>`.

    Note: In order to run `puzzlesolver.py` you will need to install numpy through pip by running the following command. Also, this is in Python 3, NOT Python 2.

        python3 -m pip install numpy

    If you do not have pip installed, you can do so by following the guide [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

2. Again, this is in Python version 3. Not in python version 2. It needs to be ran via python3 to work as designed. Additionally, it NEEDS numpy to function properly.
